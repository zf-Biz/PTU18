This folder is dedicated for regression models: Multiple Linear Regression,  SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression. I am not using Polynomial Regression, because dataset has quite a lot features and I am using just a simple Razor laptop, which is little bit old by todays standards. For dataset, I am using weather forecast from https://api.meteo.lt/. Dataset consists of forecast time, air temperature, feels like temperature, wind speed, wind gust, wind direction, cloud cover, sea level pressure, relative humidity, total precipitation, condition code (i.e. cloudy, rain, fog and etc.). Also same models are written in .ipynb file format, that can be viewed in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab and others. All regression files try to predict temperature.
