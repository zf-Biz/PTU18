This folder here, called ML_projects is dedicated to my learning experience of Udemy course called "Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R" (https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING). It is dedicated for my code snippets, that I wrote in order to learn and establish knowledge. The course itself covers Data Preprocessing, Regression models, Classification models, : Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Clustering: models, Association Rule Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing models, Deep Learning, Dimensionality Reduction, Model Selection & Boosting tactics. First in Python, then in R. Find more information about the models and data that I use  in every subfolder.
